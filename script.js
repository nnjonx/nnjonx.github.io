                    <p>Hello! My name is Johnny Nguyen. I'm currently a senior at the University Of Missouri-Kansas City pursuing my Bachelors Of Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in May 2024. I'm currently searching for an internship/ job experience so that I can further my knowledge, education, and experience to further develop my career in the technology field. Recently, I've created a mock application for an energy company where the user can insert data that is held within a local table where the user can interact with a dashboard, create an invoice, manage personal information, etc for a customer. My goals are to further my education within the technological field, develop strong connections with others in the field, and work towards my ideal future where I'm always learning about and exploring the ever-evolving technological advancements in our society.</p>
